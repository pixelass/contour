# Getting Started

## Install

```shell
# npm
npm install @contour/react --save;
# yarn
yarn add @contour/react --save
```

## Basic Usage

Contour needs to have at least one Provider. We suggest calling it as early in your application as
possible.

```tsx
import GridProvider from "@contour/react/provider";
import Grid from "@contour/react/grid";
import Column from "@contour/react/column";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<GridProvider>
			<Grid>
				<Column>Contour</Column>
			</Grid>
		</GridProvider>
	);
}
```
