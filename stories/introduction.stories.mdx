# Introduction

Contour is a grid-system, bBuilt on css-variables.  
It offers a lightweight implementation with seemingly endless possibilities.

## Value Proposition

Contour offers several advantages over other libraries.

-   [Responsive column collapsing](#responsive-column-collapsing)
-   [Inheritance of column count](#inheritance-of-column-count)
-   [Compound grids](#compound-grids)
-   [Intentionally breaking the grid](#intentionally-breaking-the-grid)
-   [Grid vs. Flexbox](#grid-vs-flexbox)

### Responsive column collapsing

Contour is a mobile-first/watch-first grid. It uses as many columns as applicable per viewport.
This makes working with Contour intuitive.

### Inheritance of column count

Contour is built on inheritance. Rows inherit their column-count from the parent column. A row
inside a column with `colSpan: 2` has 2 columns, while a row inside a column with `colSpan: 4` has
4 columns.

Working with contour on a component level is very easy. It does not matter where you use your
component, it will always fit the grid (assuming you configured it correctly)

### Compound grids

A compound grid follows a logic different from the main grid. You might want to render a different
amount of columns for a specific section.

You can read more about compound grids in these articles:

### Intentionally breaking the grid

In some cases we might want to extend an element beyond the grid. To allow this we added a special
column component called `BreakoutColumn`. It offers several options to break free from the column
boundaries.

### Grid vs. Flexbox

Contour allows you to switch between grid-layout and flexbox. They work very similar but offer
different features. With Contour, you can choose the strategy freely since Contour allows you to
mix Grid-layout and Flexbox.
